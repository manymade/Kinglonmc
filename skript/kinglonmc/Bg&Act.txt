About Kinglonmc ?
From 2020-2022 the server was active & online to other players. As of now, 
it is no longer in service. She was primarily a single-server setup focused on the 
classic Kit-PvP game mode. Sometime in 2022 the game mode was switched to SoupPvP. The 
server was founded by Kinglonmc, who was originally known as Stampysmith.

Plan?
Kinglonmc (2026) will be redeveloped as a fully functional Kit-PvP server built entirely from 
scratch, with no previous code. This is just a remake, no word of a official KLMC server this year or 
anytime in the future.
